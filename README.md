# GPU Data Science Tutor - Self-Corrective RAG System

A comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for GPU-accelerated data science education. The system combines web documentation, Jupyter notebooks, and Python code examples to provide accurate, well-cited responses about CUDA programming, RAPIDS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other GPU computing frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Multi-Source Knowledge Base
- Loads 90+ GPU data science URLs from CSV
- Integrates Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and Python files (.py)
- Supports mixed citation formats for different source types

### 🧠 Self-Corrective RAG Pipeline
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Multi-attempt document retrieval with relevance grading
- **Hallucination Detection**: Validates responses against source material
- **Answer Quality Assessment**: Ensures responses adequately address questions
- **Automatic Regeneration**: Improves responses through iterative refinement

### 📚 Intelligent Citation System
- Numbered citations [1], [2], [3] with proper source attribution
- Reference validation to prevent hallucinated sources
- Automatic reference section generation

### 💬 Conversation Management
- Chat history tracking for follow-up questions
- Context-aware response generation
- Document exclusion to prevent repetitive retrievals
